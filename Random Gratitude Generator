###A simple python script that randomly generates a reason to be grateful for today###

import random

gratitude_list = ["a great AI focus session", "staying calm in the midst of the storms", "resisting overwhelm and panic", "facing the challenges head on instead of shutting down", "keeping a good attitude inspite of everything"]

power_words = ["Resilience", "Determination", "Hope", "Faith", "Grit", "Tenacity"] 
    
gratitude = random.choice(gratitude_list)
power_word = random.choice(power_words)

print(f"Today I'm grateful for: {gratitude}")
print(f"Today I embodied: {power_word}")
